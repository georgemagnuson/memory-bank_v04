### **Dependency Chain:**
1. **MBSW** coordinates development of both projects
2. **memory-bank_v04** provides foundation layer (documents_v2, search, context)
3. **SPEC-WORKFLOW** builds on foundation to provide methodology tools
4. **Integration** creates unified spec-driven development system

## 📋 **KEY INTEGRATION POINTS**

### **Shared Schema Elements:**
```sql
-- documents_v2 table shared across all projects
spec_name TEXT,           -- Spec identifier for workflow coordination
spec_phase TEXT,          -- 'requirements', 'design', 'tasks', 'implementation'  
spec_status TEXT,         -- 'draft', 'review', 'approved', 'implemented'
task_id TEXT,             -- Task identifier for spec breakdown
parent_spec_uuid TEXT,    -- Hierarchical spec relationships
```

### **Shared Metadata Standards:**
```json
{
  "project_context": "memory-bank_v04 | SPEC-WORKFLOW | coordination",
  "integration_level": 1-5,
  "cross_project_dependencies": ["project_uuid_list"],
  "coordination_notes": "MBSW coordination context",
  "workflow_phase": "requirements | design | tasks | implementation"
