# Memory Bank + Spec Workflow Integration Plan

**Generated:** 2025-07-20.2113  
**Purpose:** Strategic three-phase plan for integrating claude-code-spec-workflow with memory-bank_v04  
**Status:** Design phase - ready for implementation decisions

## 🎯 **STRATEGIC APPROACH**

Three-phase development strategy for clean separation of concerns with deep integration capability:

1. **Memory Bank v04** - Spec-workflow ready foundation
2. **Spec-Workflow** - Memory Bank integrated system  
3. **Unified System** - Combined memory-bank-spec-workflow

## **Phase 1: Memory Bank v04 - Spec-Workflow Ready**

### **Goal:** Enhance Memory Bank with spec-workflow awareness and foundations

### **Key Enhancements:**

**1. Enhanced Document System (building on planned FTS)**
- **Document Types**: Add spec-workflow specific document types
- **Spec Metadata**: Track spec workflow phases and status
- **Importance Ratings**: Spec documents with appropriate importance levels

```sql
-- Enhanced document schema for spec-workflow readiness
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS documents (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    document_id TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    document_type TEXT NOT NULL,     -- Include: 'spec_requirements', 'spec_design', 'spec_tasks', 'spec_implementation'
    importance_rating INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 5,
    project_uuid TEXT,
    file_path TEXT,
    tags TEXT,
    -- Spec-workflow specific fields
    spec_name TEXT,                  -- NULL for non-spec documents
    spec_phase TEXT,                 -- 'requirements', 'design', 'tasks', 'implementation'
    spec_status TEXT,                -- 'draft', 'approved', 'in_progress', 'completed'
    created_date TEXT NOT NULL,
    modified_date TEXT NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (project_uuid) REFERENCES projects (uuid)
);
```

**2. Spec-Workflow Semantic Mappings**
- **Terminology**: Bootstrap semantic equivalents for spec workflow terms
- **Context Domains**: Add 'spec_workflow' as context domain
- **Pattern Recognition**: Semantic mappings for spec document patterns

```python
# Spec workflow semantic bootstrap
spec_workflow_semantics = {
    "requirements": ["user_stories", "acceptance_criteria", "EARS", "functional_requirements", "specifications"],
    "design": ["architecture", "mermaid", "components", "interfaces", "data_models", "technical_design"],
    "tasks": ["implementation", "subtasks", "atomic_tasks", "test_driven", "task_breakdown"],
    "execute": ["implement", "develop", "code", "build", "create", "construct"],
    "workflow": ["spec", "specification", "feature", "development", "methodology"]
}
```

**3. Spec-Aware Search Enhancement**
- **Phase Filtering**: Search within specific spec phases
- **Cross-Project Patterns**: Find similar specs across projects
- **Template Discovery**: Locate reusable spec patterns

**4. Enhanced Session Management**
- **Multi-Phase Sessions**: Handle transitions between spec phases
- **Context Continuity**: Maintain context across spec workflow phases
- **Progress Tracking**: Track spec workflow progress in session metadata

### **New Memory Bank Tools for Spec-Workflow Readiness:**

```python
# Spec document management
save_spec_document(spec_name, phase, content, project_uuid, status='draft')
search_spec_patterns(query, phase_filter=None, project_filter=None)
get_related_specs(current_spec, similarity_threshold=0.7)
get_spec_by_phase(spec_name, phase, project_uuid)

# Spec workflow tracking
track_spec_workflow_progress(spec_name, current_phase, project_uuid)
get_spec_workflow_status(spec_name, project_uuid)
advance_spec_phase(spec_name, from_phase, to_phase, project_uuid)

# Enhanced session management
create_spec_aware_session_starter(spec_name, phase, project_context)
load_spec_context(spec_name, phase, project_uuid)
save_spec_session_context(spec_name, phase, context_data)

# Template and pattern discovery
find_spec_templates(spec_type, project_type=None)
analyze_spec_patterns(spec_phase, success_criteria=None)
suggest_similar_specs(current_spec_content, threshold=0.7)
```

## **Phase 2: Spec-Workflow with Memory Bank Integration**

### **Goal:** Build spec-workflow system that leverages Memory Bank capabilities

### **Memory Bank Integration Points:**

**1. Context Loading**
- **Auto-Context**: Each spec phase automatically loads relevant project context
- **Related Content**: Surface related specs, designs, and implementations
- **Historical Context**: Access to previous similar spec workflows

**2. Persistent Storage**
- **Auto-Save**: All spec outputs automatically saved to Memory Bank
- **Version Control**: Track spec evolution and decision history
- **Importance Ratings**: Automatic importance assignment based on spec phase

**3. Semantic Enhancement**
- **Intelligent Search**: Use Memory Bank semantics for spec content discovery
- **Suggestion Engine**: Suggest related requirements, designs, and patterns
- **Term Expansion**: Auto-expand spec terminology using semantic equivalents

**4. Template Integration**
- **Dynamic Templates**: Templates pulled from Memory Bank document system
- **Learning Templates**: Templates that evolve based on successful patterns
- **Context-Aware**: Templates that adapt to project type and context

**5. Cross-Project Learning**
- **Pattern Recognition**: Learn from successful spec implementations
- **Reusable Components**: Identify and suggest reusable design patterns
- **Best Practices**: Accumulate institutional knowledge across projects

### **Enhanced Spec Commands with Memory Bank Integration:**

```bash
# Memory Bank enhanced spec workflow commands
/mb-spec-create user-authentication "Secure login with Django"
  # → Creates spec in Memory Bank, loads Django context, suggests related patterns

/mb-spec-requirements
  # → Auto-loads project context, references similar requirements, saves to Memory Bank

/mb-spec-design
  # → References related designs from Memory Bank, suggests patterns, includes Mermaid

/mb-spec-tasks
  # → Learns from similar task breakdowns, suggests atomic tasks, tracks dependencies

/mb-spec-execute 1
  # → Context-aware implementation with relevant code examples and patterns

/mb-spec-status
  # → Enhanced status with Memory Bank context and cross-project insights

/mb-spec-patterns [search-term]
  # → Search across all projects for spec patterns and successful implementations
```

### **Integration Architecture:**

```python
# Spec workflow enhanced with Memory Bank
class MemoryBankSpecWorkflow:
    def __init__(self, memory_bank_instance):
        self.mb = memory_bank_instance
        self.current_spec = None
        self.current_phase = None
    
    async def create_spec(self, spec_name, description, project_uuid):
        # Load related context from Memory Bank
        context = await self.mb.load_project_context(project_uuid)
        related_specs = await self.mb.search_spec_patterns(description)
        
        # Create spec with enhanced context
        spec_document = self.generate_spec_document(spec_name, description, context, related_specs)
        
        # Save to Memory Bank with importance=9
        await self.mb.save_spec_document(spec_name, 'created', spec_document, project_uuid)
        
        return spec_document
    
    async def generate_requirements(self, spec_name, project_uuid):
        # Load spec context and related patterns
        spec_context = await self.mb.load_spec_context(spec_name, 'created', project_uuid)
        similar_requirements = await self.mb.search_spec_patterns(spec_context['description'], phase_filter='requirements')
        
        # Generate enhanced requirements
        requirements = self.create_requirements_with_context(spec_context, similar_requirements)
        
        # Save and track progress
        await self.mb.save_spec_document(spec_name, 'requirements', requirements, project_uuid)
        await self.mb.track_spec_workflow_progress(spec_name, 'requirements', project_uuid)
        
        return requirements
```

## **Phase 3: Unified Memory Bank Spec Workflow**

### **Goal:** Single integrated system combining the best of both

### **Integration Benefits:**

**1. Seamless Workflow**
- **Single Command Set**: Unified commands that handle both context and spec workflow
- **Transparent Integration**: Users don't need to think about two separate systems
- **Intelligent Automation**: System automatically handles context loading and saving

**2. Enhanced Intelligence**
- **Semantic-Driven**: Memory Bank semantics enhance every spec phase
- **Pattern Learning**: System learns from successful implementations across projects
- **Predictive Suggestions**: Intelligent suggestions based on historical success patterns

**3. Session Continuity**
- **Never Lose Context**: Seamless transitions between spec phases and sessions
- **Resume Anywhere**: Pick up spec workflow at any phase with full context
- **Cross-Session Learning**: Context accumulates across multiple development sessions

**4. Cross-Project Intelligence**
- **Institutional Knowledge**: Specs inform each other across projects
- **Pattern Reuse**: Successful patterns become templates for future specs
- **Evolution Tracking**: Watch how spec approaches evolve and improve

### **Unified System Architecture:**

```python
# Single integrated system
class MemoryBankSpecWorkflowUnified:
    """
    Unified system that seamlessly combines Memory Bank context management
    with structured spec-driven development workflow
    """
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.memory_bank = MemoryBankMCP()
        self.spec_workflow = SpecWorkflowEngine(self.memory_bank)
        self.unified_commands = UnifiedCommandSet(self.memory_bank, self.spec_workflow)
    
    # Single command set that handles everything
    async def unified_spec_create(self, spec_name, description):
        # Automatically: detect project, load context, create spec, save to MB
        pass
    
    async def unified_spec_requirements(self):
        # Automatically: load context, generate requirements, learn patterns, save
        pass
    
    async def unified_spec_implement(self, task_id):
        # Automatically: load context, execute task, save results, update progress
        pass
```

### **Unified Command Structure:**

```bash
# Single unified command set
/spec-create user-authentication "Secure login with Django"
  # → Full Memory Bank + Spec Workflow integration automatically

/spec-next
  # → Intelligent next step based on current phase and context

/spec-continue [phase]
  # → Resume spec workflow at any phase with full context restoration

/spec-discover [search-term]
  # → Discover patterns, templates, and related specs across all projects

/spec-learn [pattern-name]
  # → Add successful pattern to institutional knowledge base
```

## **Implementation Benefits**

### **✅ Clean Architecture**
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each system maintains its core purpose
- **Clear Integration Boundaries**: Well-defined interfaces between components
- **Independent Development**: Can develop and test each component separately

### **✅ Evolutionary Development**
